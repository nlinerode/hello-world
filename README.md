Hello world repository startup

I am a beginner front-end web-designer. Have to start somewhere!
I'm currently focusing on learning and mastering HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, just so I can grasp the fundamentals of web-design.

I plan on resuming studying C#, as well as any other language that I see fit to pursue in the future!
